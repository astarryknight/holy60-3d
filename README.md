The CAD files to modify and print for yourself can be found on printables (https://www.printables.com/model/975609-holy60-keyboard-case).

## Print and Assembly tips:
Some printers may be able to print without supports, but for the cleanest results, I would recommend using some supports (I love organic). Infill doesn't need to be incredibly high to produce good results, I used 25% for initial prints and it was pretty solid. Layer height of 0.15 or less is recommended if you want a smooth finish on your print.

Holes are designed for m3 standoffs that go along with my custom PCB, although some holes do interfere with stabilizer wires.

Designed for the KB2024 microcontroller, although might also fit with the Arduino Pro Micro with some tweaking.

## Disclaimer: this is not affiliated with kbdfans in any way. This was a design I did on my own without any provided CAD files, using images from their website. It is also NOT a 1 to 1 replica, as some dimensions and features may not be the same.
